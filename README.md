# Keylogger-Code
HOW TO USE:
In order to get this code to work, you must download the three main files titled K-logger_Code.py, K-logger-internal-code.bat and K-logger-start.bat. once you have these files downloaded in the same directory, you only have to start the K-logger-start.bat file in order to start the keylogger, once the keylogger has started it will run in a minimized cmd prompt window and will document what keys where pressed in a .txt file within the same directory

This code was created by me and was created in the vision that eventually I will have made a functioning Keylogger to prove that I can actually code stuff and things.

I have managed to get the code to work along with adding two batch files in order for the script to run correctly, also on a side note, my kaspersky anti-virus did not detect this as it was running when it usually would detect it which is cool!.
