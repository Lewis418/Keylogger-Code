# Keylogger-Code
HOW TO USE:
In order to get this code to work, you must download the four main files titled keyboard-package-check.bat, K-logger_Code.py, K-logger-internal-code.bat and K-logger-start.bat. once you have these files downloaded in the same directory, you only have to start the K-logger-start.bat file in order to start the keylogger, once the keylogger has started it will run all cmd prompts in a minimized window, the first window will be for the package check file which checks to see if you have the keyboard module installed, if not then it will be installed, the second prompt is a timeout window which just gives the first prompt window time to do its job. The third and final prompt is the keylogger itself and it will document what keys where pressed for as long as the cmd prompt stays open within a .txt file named keystrokes.txt within the same directory.

This code was created by me and was created in the vision that eventually I will have made a functioning Keylogger to prove that I can actually code stuff and things.

I have managed to get the code to work along with adding two batch files in order for the script to run correctly.

I have just remembered that in order for this to work, the device would need to have python installed along with the keyboard python module, the keyboard module is easy enough to install within the batch script however the actual installation of python would most likely be too lengthy which is not good.

I have created a batch script that checks to see whether the keyboard module is installed or not and if not then it installs it, this file will make sure that the key logger itself will work if the individual has python installed and has python added to the command line PATH.
