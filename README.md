# Keylogger-Code
HOW TO USE:
In order to get this code to work, you must download the three main files titled K-logger_Code.py, K-logger-internal-code.bat and K-logger-start.bat. once you have these files downloaded in the same directory, you only have to start the K-logger-start.bat file in order to start the keylogger, once the keylogger has started it will run in a minimized cmd prompt window and will document what keys where pressed in a .txt file within the same directory

This code was created by me and was created in the vision that eventually I will have made a functioning Keylogger to prove that I can actually code stuff and things.

I have managed to get the code to work along with adding two batch files in order for the script to run correctly, also on a side note, my kaspersky anti-virus did not detect this as it was running when it usually would detect it which is cool!.

I have just remembered that in order for this to work, the device would need to have python installed on said device along with the keyboard python module, the keyboard module is easy enough to install within the batch script however the actual installation of python would most likely be too lengthy which is not good.
